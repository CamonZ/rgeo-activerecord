  # RGeo extends ActiveRecord::Base to include the following new class
  # attributes. These attributes are inherited by subclasses, and can
  # be overridden in subclasses.
  # 
  # === ActiveRecord::Base::rgeo_factory_generator
  # 
  # The value of this attribute is a RGeo::Feature::FactoryGenerator
  # that is used to generate the proper factory when loading geometry
  # objects from the database. For example, if the data being loaded
  # has M but not Z coordinates, and an embedded SRID, then this
  # FactoryGenerator is called with the appropriate configuration to
  # obtain a factory with those properties. This factory is the one
  # associated with the actual geometry properties of the ActiveRecord
  # object.
