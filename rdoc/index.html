<p><a href="RGeo/ActiveRecord.html">RGeo::ActiveRecord</a> is an optional <a
href="http://github.com/dazuma/rgeo">RGeo</a> module providing spatial
extensions for ActiveRecord, as well as a set of helpers for writing
spatial ActiveRecord adapters based on RGeo.</p>

<h3 id="label-Summary">Summary</h3>

<p>RGeo is a key component for writing location-aware applications in the Ruby
programming language. At its core is an implementation of the industry
standard OGC Simple Features Specification, which provides data
representations of geometric objects such as points, lines, and polygons,
along with a set of geometric analysis operations. See the <a
href="README_rdoc.html">README</a> for the “rgeo” gem for more information.</p>

<p><a href="RGeo/ActiveRecord.html">RGeo::ActiveRecord</a> is an optional RGeo
add-on module providing spatial extensions for ActiveRecord, as well as a
set of helpers for writing spatial ActiveRecord adapters based on RGeo.</p>

<h3 id="label-Installation">Installation</h3>

<p><a href="RGeo/ActiveRecord.html">RGeo::ActiveRecord</a> has the following
requirements:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Ruby 1.8.7 or later. Ruby 1.9.2 or later preferred.</p>
</li><li>
<p>rgeo 0.3.20 or later.</p>
</li><li>
<p>activerecord 3.0.3 or later. Earlier versions will not work. Should be
compatible with Rails versions through 3.2.x.</p>
</li><li>
<p>arel 2.0.6 or later. Earlier versions will not work.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Generally, ActiveRecord adapters which depend on this module should be
installed as gems, and they will install this module automatically as a
dependency. However, you can also install it manually as a gem:</p>

<pre>gem install rgeo
gem install rgeo-activerecord</pre>

<p>See the <a href="README_rdoc.html">README</a> for the “rgeo” gem, a
required dependency, for further installation information.</p>

<h3 id="label-To-do+list">To-do list</h3>

<p>We consider this gem to be in a late alpha state. There are a still a few
holes in the intended functionality, but it is now being tested in a
variety of contexts, and we know of several successful production
deployments.</p>

<p>We are also currently working on a mechanism for constructing complex
spatial queries via extensions to <a href="Arel.html">Arel</a>. This work
is in the experimental stage.</p>
